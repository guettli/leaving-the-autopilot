Practical hints how to leave autopilot for some minutes

I call it "autopilot". In the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" Daniel Kahneman calls it "System 1".

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow

System 1 is great. It helps you to do things with little mental energy.

If you are young, you use both ways of thinking: slow thinking and fast thinking.

If you get older, you spent much more time doing things you have already done. I think you use System2 less often, if you are older.

I feel between being young and being old. I am 43 years old today.

Since some months I like to leave the autopilot for some day. It is fun and a bit crazy, it helps me to feel less old.

Here are some practical hints how I practice "leaving the autopilot for some minutes".

* Drive a different way home. Monday to Friday I drive the same way from home to work with my bike. I try to drive a different way at least once a week.

* protocol of thougts. I hear relaxing music. Lay down on the floor on a warm carpet (in winter I take a carpet with electric heating) put my legs on the couch. Take a paper and pen. Close the eyes and wait for the thougts that come to my mind. I try not to judge (there are not good or bad thoughts). I take a note with the pen, then close the eyes again. There are thoughts about the future, about the past, crazy unrealistic dreams, boring items of daily live .... Sometimes it is called "monkey mind" or "crazy chicken". I don't try to tame the thoughts. They come and they go. I am just noticing them.
